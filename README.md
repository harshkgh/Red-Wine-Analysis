# Red-Wine-Analysis
The study shows how the quality of red wine is depended on the multiple factors and chemicals, how different proportions of the chemicals like alcohol, sugar sulfur dioxide gives different quality of red wine.
The methods used are regression and correlation analysis.
Regression is used for knowing the relation between the dependent variable and independent variable like quality and pH.
Correlation Analysis is used for knowing the strength of the linear relationship between the variables.
For results I have used charts with all the necessary results.
